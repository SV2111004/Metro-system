# 🚇 Metro System - C++ Project

## 📌 Description  
The **Metro System** is a comprehensive **C++ console-based application** that simulates the functionality of a modern metro transit system.  
The project is divided into two user modes — **User** and **Staff** — each offering tailored functionalities. It features a **login/signup system** for secure access, **metro map navigation**, **card management**, **utility-based station searches**, and **staff-specific operations** like patrolling and cleaning routes.
> 🎓 *Group Project developed as part of our college curriculum to simulate a functional metro transit system using graph algorithms, OOP, and console-based UI in C++.*  
> 🔧 Developed by a team of 4 — Shubhra, Akshat, Janvi, and Jitendra.
