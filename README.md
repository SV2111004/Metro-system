# 🚇 Metro System - C++ Project

## 📌 Description  
The **Metro System** is a comprehensive **C++ console-based application** that simulates the functionality of a modern metro transit system.  
The project is divided into two user modes — **User** and **Staff** — each offering tailored functionalities. It features a **login/signup system** for secure access, **metro map navigation**, **card management**, **utility-based station searches**, and **staff-specific operations** like patrolling and cleaning routes.
